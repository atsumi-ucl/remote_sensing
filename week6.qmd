# Summary

This week, we looked at classification of remote sensed data for various applications.

Land cover land use classification is a classic example of classification of remote sensed data. We looked at how different data or sensors could be used and different techniques could be applied, depending on the objectives of studies.

Machine learning - science of computer learning process - is used for the classification of remote sensed data. There are various learning types: CART (classification and regression trees) where the Gini impurity is used to decide which attribute is the top of the tree,

# Application

For the classification of landcover for slum communities, various data/sensors and techniques have been used.
