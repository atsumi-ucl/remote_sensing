# Summary

This week, we looked at classification of remote sensed data for various applications.

Land cover land use classification is a classic example of classification of remote sensed data. We looked at how different data or sensors could be used and different techniques could be applied, depending on the objectives of studies. Below I describe key steps / elements in conducting land cover land use supervised classification.

## Training data

For machine learning supervised classification tasks, one will need training data with labels. All classes should be represented. According to Jensen, the rule of thumb is that you will need a minimum of 10xN pixels of training data if training data are being extracted from N bands [@jensen2014]. That doesn't seem a lot.

According to Jensen, training data may be obtained by fieldwork, interpretation of aerial photography, map analysis and personal experience, but ideally each training site should be visited and its perimeter or centroid coordinates are measured directly with a GPS. Another method Jensen introduces is to use a seed programme, which finds pixels with spectral characteristics similar to the original seed pixel the analyst specifies. This way, the analyst will have collected homogeneous training set.

So depending on the available resources, one can visit the study area with a GPS handset and collect the coordinates for each class, which of course requires more resources, or study arial image and create a training dataset, which is desk-based and thus cheaper.

## Feature selection/selection of optimum bands

A next step would be to select which bands to use. Graphical methods such as feature space plots (such as the one plotted in week 1) can be used to decide which bands to use. This approach perhaps is useful if one knows the features of the area of interest very well and can interpret the clustering of certain values in a qualitative way.

Equally, statistical methods such as the Principal Component Analysis may be used to select the optimum bands that maximise the amount of variance explained by a new set of imagery. This I think can be quite powerful if one has so many bands to explore. It would take forever if one plots (two dimensional) feature space like above for each possible pair of features when there are 50 bands!

## Machine learning algorithms

Once you have a training dataset with labels and decide on which bands to use, the next step would be to decide which learning model to use and train it. There are various learning types: CART (classification and regression trees) are amongst many learning types, where the Gini impurity (which by definition is the probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen element in a dataset if it was randomly labelled according to the distribution of labels in the subset) is used to decide the best split.

# Application

For the classification of landcover/landuse for informal settlement communities, various data/sensors and techniques can be used on GEE or in other software.

1.  I liked the authors (Eg. Leonita et al [-@leonita2018]) who studied the morphology (forms and structures) or ontology (nature) of local slums and incoporated it into the selection of bands

    For example, they observed high density, lack of vegetation so used NDVI and built-up density index. In total, they used 78 bands from Pleiades. The authors used the Sequential Forward Selection method to select features, which is another method which wasn't discussed this week. They then used Random Forest and Support Vector Machine as classification algorithms.

2.  Matarira et al., used Sentinel 2A image collection on GEE with a Random Forest algorithm for classification [@matarira2022a]. Their feature selection was mainly based on literature review and included a total of 42 features. This is of course acceptable but I would have like to see local context and local slum ontology incorporated in selecting the features.

# Reflection

It was **very** useful to actually see how land cover land use classification may be done. My question I had in week 1 (whether it is a problem that I couldn't see houses in the 10m spatial image) was resolved to some extent. Generally speaking, this depends on what you would want to classify. If training data come from a field visit rather than creating it from analysing aerial imagery, then it probably doesn't matter whether the analyst could visually identify objects in order to label them. Of course, if a pixel includes different classes, the value on each pixel would not be very precise which I imagine would affect classification accuracy.

In the practical material for this week, the training data was created from GEE. I found it difficult to create training data in this way because I didn't know landcover types of the location I was looking at. I think this method of obtaining training data is possible and acceptable if one has good knowledge about the study area.

It was a mystery before this module how to do slum mapping with EO data but I think I can have a go at it (in the summer) as I can now understand the literature in this area. The next step for me (before the summer) would be to understand the morphology or ontology of slums in the area of interest, so that would feed into feature selection.
