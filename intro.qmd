This is a learning diary of Atsumi Hirose.

I am looking forward to learning remote sensing on this module!

A bit of my backgruond as a way of introduction. I have (doctoral and postdoctoral) training in the epidemiology of maternal and newborn health. My postdoctoral work mainly has focused on understanding health system factors to improve pregnancy outcomes in resource-limited countries in Africa and Asia.

My other strand of research which I hope to expand in the future is the investigation of geospatial factors that affect maternal and newborn health. For example, this so far has included how physical distances between home and healthcare services contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes and how the location pregnant women live in (urban slums) contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes.

Traditional health survey data do not provide sufficient information with good coverage to understand the environments where women live in, but they are usually georeferenced. In order to pursue my interest in geospatial health inequalities, I have become interested to using Earth Observation data, this is why I am doing a master degree again. I am hoping to include environmental and climate-related factors into my future research.

Anyway, I am looking forward to learning how to manipulate remotely sensed data including Google Earth Engine later in the term.
